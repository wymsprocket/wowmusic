However, the Great Sundering shattered the temple - sinking it beneath the waves of the Veiled Sea. There, the temple remained untouched until naga and satyr, drawn by its ancient power, emerged to plumb its secrets.\n\nLegends hold that Aku\'mai, a favored pet of the primordial Old Gods, has taken up residence within the temple\'s ruins. The cult known as the Twilight\'s Hammer has also come to bask in Aku\'mai\'s evil presence - and members of the shamanic order known as the Earthen Ring rush to oppose them, knowing that where the Old Gods are invoked, dangers to the whole of Azeroth cannot be far behind.\n\nThis underwater cove can be tricky to navigate for the first time, but it\'s a great place to hone your skills and find your role when in a group.\nLevel appropriate groups should watch out for two things. The first is that there are many magic casting Naga which, when amassed in numbers, can do a good deal of damage. Always keep a warrior with shield bash on any casting mobs, or any other class that can stun/interrupt like Shamans and Paladins. Also, this is a great dungeon to try out crowd control. Many of the enemies pulled to you will come with friends. In addition, there are invisible Satyr that you cannot see until they have come close enough to aggro you.\n\nCaution should be used when combating the murlocs. Once at low health, they run quite fast, often running back towards the other murlocs and the murloc boss Gelihast. Keep a form of snare on these guys. The latter part of the instance includes the Twilight Cultists. These foes come in groups of two or three, but often can include more if you aren\'t aware of wanderers. The ideal way to avoid an unwanted add is to pull with range, targeting the casters first (which you can get to follow you by cutting the Line of Sight, i.e. turning around a corner), and sheeping, sapping, or off tanking the adds. Also, having the highest level person in your group do the pulling helps, due to their smaller aggro radius.\n\nThe \'summoning chamber\' with Twilight Lord Kelris includes many other cultists in the room. It is recommended to use the walled off entrance to your advantage, pulling the mobs one by one from the large room until Kelris is alone. After the room is cleared, he is ready to be engaged safely. Once he is defeated, all four candles pieces on the middle altar will need to be lit in order to advance past the large door to the final boss. Right-click these one at a time because a small group of mobs is summoned from the adjacent doors every time you do. Defeat these one at a time to avoid death.\n\nThe final boss is relatively easy if you have a dedicated tank and healer. See walk-through for Aku\'mai. A stylishly hatted dwarf will await you at the end, giving Alliance players an option to port to Darnassus.\n\n[b][u]Ghamoo-Ra:[/u][/b]\nWhen the Twilight\'s Hammer cult arrived, its followers roused and imprisoned one of the last peaceful creatures living in Elune\'s temple. The cult delighted in tormenting the giant turtle for years, flaying its mind and body until it succumbed to madness. Naming the beast Ghamoo-Ra, the cultists trained it to attack outsiders and defend the Old Gods\' shrine.\n\nNote: Tameable by Hunters.\n\nGhamoo-Ra lives on the small island in the second cavern of the instance. He roams around the center of the landmass and is surrounded by several other turtles. The additional turtles are neutral, and Ghamoo-Ra can be engaged without disturbing these other beasts.\nThe fight with Ghamoo-Ra is fairly straightforward, although due to Ghamoo-Ra\'s high armor value the encounter can last a fair amount of time if your group is melee heavy or generally low on DPS. He only casts Trample, which is an AoE physical damage spell. It can be blocked.\n\n[b][u]Lady Sarevess:[/u][/b]\nThe Twilight\'s Hammer granted Lady Sarevess her own private cove within Blackfathom Deeps, continuously sending her fresh sacrifices. The cultists hope that her rituals and research will result in magical protection that will allow them to worship the terrifying hydra at the deeps\' core without fear of becoming his next meal.\n\nShe can kill you if you are not too careful, for she will spam Forked Lightning quite a few times so have the tank face her away from the rest of the group. Other than that, there is nothing special about her. She moves around the cave, so pull her when there are no mobs near.\n\n[b][u]Gelihast:[/u][/b]\nThe Old Gods called, and Gelihast answered, forcing his way into Blackfathom Deeps and slaughtering nearly a dozen surprised Twilight\'s Hammer cultists with his twin swords. Impressed by his ferocity and brutality, the cult allowed him to stay, and he built his own shrine to offer sacrifices and receive blessings from the ominous presence in the temple ruins.\n\nHe goes down quite quickly but he can interrupt and kill casters very quickly, dealing high damage as he is wielding 2 swords and has an incredible attack speed. Killing him allows access to an altar, when used it gives the beneficial debuff Blessing of Blackfathom. Warriors can kill him in a few seconds with  [Retaliation] and a 2-handed weapon. Gelihast is in a large room filled with Blindlight Murlocs, and it is not uncommon for a fleeing Murloc to pull him into the fight causing a wipe.\n\n[b][u]Lorgus Jett:[/u][/b]\nLorgus Jett is a level 25 rare human member of the Twilight\'s Hammer in the Moonshrine Ruins of Blackfathom Deeps. He has a variable spawn point, the earliest of which is in a dead end tunnel just after Gelihast and the last of which is near the first pull of Twilight cultists.\n\n[b][u]Old Serra\'kis:[/u][/b]\nMany of the creatures swimming beneath the Moonshrine Ruins were killed for food after the Twilight\'s Hammer cult took up residence, but the largest thresher in the water proved to be uncatchable, and those who persisted in hunting it inevitably died in the attempt.\n\nFinding Serra\'kis is harder than the actual fight. To reach him, you must dive into the water around Moonshrine Sanctum and swim under the left side of the ruins. Thankfully the fight isn\'t tough and as long as you\'re careful not to run out of breath you shouldn\'t have any problems. Having a Warlock or Shaman to cast Water Breathing is helpful here. If you are unable to do this, it will be difficult to kill him quickly enough because the cave he is located in does not have an opening to the surface for air. Kiting him out of the cave may be a better option than fighting him inside it in this case.\nAlso note that Serra\'kis regularly heals himself for a small portion of his health using a melee ability. With decent dps, this will not be a problem. Those groups with unusually low dps may not be able to overcome his healing, as can be the case when a weak group of 3 or 4 attempt Serra\'kis.',date:'2012-12-10T22:50:06-06:00',rating:0,indent:0,roles:256,deleted:0,outofdate:0,userRating:0,replies:[{"commentid":"1779315","id":"778340","body":"jesus dude how long did it take you to type that?","userid":"749141","username":"elionor","roles":"0","creationdate":"2014-10-13T14:48:56-05:00","lasteditdate":"1969-12-31T18:00:00-06:00","rating":"0"}]},{commentv2:1,number:56,id:1779317,nreplies:0,sticky:0,user:'jessican666',body:'[b][u]Continued[/u][/b]\n\n[b][u]Twilight Lord Kelris[/u][/b]\nWhen the cultists found a strange three-headed creature in the belly of Blackfathom Deeps, Twilight Lord Kelris was convinced the hydra was a herald of the Old Gods\' return to Azeroth... and his ticket to immortality. Kelris personally supervises the growth of the monster, even feeding him his own subjects to satisfy his wild hunger.\n\nKelris is in a trance as you enter the room, so you have to attack him before he will respond. He is not accompanied by any guards, so it is possible to pull him without aggroing any adds. It is also unfortunately very easy to pull some more mobs in the room with him, so be careful. This should be an easy fight for a competent group. Watch for the mind control he casts periodically. He will also put players to sleep, so be prepared to pick up the slack from an incapacitated player. He runs around a lot when he is casting, so it is advisable to either clear the room before killing him, or pulling him outside onto the steps.\n\n[b][u]The Altar[/u][/b]\nThere are 4 candles on the altar he is praying to. After Kelris is dead, light these ONE at a time. Each one will spawn a large group of elites (Aku\'mai Servant) after a 5-10 second delay. Without a higher level in your group, if you light more than one at a time you will wipe.\nAfter all the candles have been lit, the door to Aku\'mai is opened.\n\n[b][u]Aku\'mai[/u][/b]\nAku\'mai, an ancient evil, carries within him a small measure of the Old Gods\' power. This three-headed hydra is greatly feared for his mindless savagery and insatiable hunger for living flesh, but the Twilight\'s Hammer worships him as a divine sign that the Old Gods will soon return.\n\nThe ancient hydra Aku\'mai, princess of the deep, has taken up residence within the Blackfathom Deeps, which once was a glorious temple dedicated to the night elves\' moon-goddess Elune. A favored pet of the primordial Old Gods, Aku\'mai has been a scourge to the Zoram Strand for ages. Drawn to Aku\'mai\'s presence in the Deeps, the cult known as the Twilight\'s Hammer has gathered to bask in the Old Gods\' evil presence by sacrificing innocents to the monstrous beast in order to gain favor with her twisted masters.\n\nAku\'mai provides a pretty straightforward fight, but that doesn\'t make it easy. The big hydra has a vast load of health and hits like a truck hitting you with a slightly smaller truck. She also has a poison attack that\'s worth keeping an eye on. Keep your tank healed and make sure he or she can keep aggro well while the rest of the group unloads everything they\'ve got onto Aku\'mai.  [Soulstone] the person who is resurrecting, cast all buffs, and give her hell.\nShe is able to reduce any tank into a bite of snakefood with a few attacks, if he or she is not protected properly. A warrior might have a better time with her, but a paladin can serve as a tank as well.\nAku\'mai is not immune to  [Fear] or snares.\n\nGood Luck.\nHappy Hunting.',date:'2012-12-10T22:54:32-06:00',rating:-1,indent:0,roles:256,deleted:0,outofdate:0,userRating:0,replies:[]},{commentv2:1,number:57,id:1875246,nreplies:0,sticky:0,user:'worthit',body:'Just a little info...\n\n[ul]\n[li]You can enter this dungeon on foot at lvl 15.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]You can queue this dungeon as specific dungeon lvl 20-30.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]In the specific dungeon finder, this dungeon is orange difficulty lvl 20-21, yellow difficulty lvl 22-26 and green difficulty lvl 27-30.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]You can queue this dungeon as random dungeon lvl 22-25.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]You have to be lvl 20 to obtain the quests, although there is one quest that drops from Baron Aquanis that you need to be lvl 21 to obtain.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nSee more [url=http://www.wowhead.com/guide=1750/dungeon-item-level-requirements]in this guide[/url].',date:'2013-07-09T19:01:02-05:00',rating:4,indent:0,roles:0,deleted:0,outofdate:0,userRating:0,replies:[],lastEdit:['2013-10-11T16:43:55-05:00',1,'worthit']},{commentv2:1,number:58,id:1971103,nreplies:1,sticky:0,user:'Havsoga',body:'Something I learned while farming for [item=6909] that I can\'t find in any comment:\n\nThe only boss you have to kill to get to [npc=4829] is [npc=4832], you can skip all the others if you, like me, only want the last boss.\n\nAlso note that BFD will probably have changed loot-tables when 6.0 goes live, so you might want to start farming if you want some items for transmogrification.',date:'2014-06-09T02:30:26-05:00',rating:1,indent:0,roles:0,deleted:0,outofdate:1,userRating:0,replies:[{"commentid":"1971103","id":"762348","body":"Trial twinks should get their gear too, especially [item=6902].","userid":"610726","username":"drewbster","roles":"0","creationdate":"2014-08-04T12:02:44-05:00","lasteditdate":"1969-12-31T18:00:00-06:00","rating":"1"}],lastEdit:['2014-06-09T02:32:08-05:00',2,'Havsoga']},{commentv2:1,number:59,id:1971503,nreplies:0,sticky:0,user:'malmern',body:'There seems to be a bugged spot underwater in BFD where you can walk normally and breathe like it was on land. \n\n41.3 | 59.5 are the coordinates if you wanna check it out ^^,',date:'2014-06-10T15:01:26-05:00',rating:-7,indent:0,roles:0,deleted:0,outofdate:0,userRating:0,replies:[]},{commentv2:1,number:60,id:1973379,nreplies:0,sticky:0,user:'Darkaara',body:'Will be completely revamped in Warlords of Draenor.',date:'2014-06-18T16:35:27-05:00',rating:0,indent:0,roles:0,deleted:0,outofdate:0,userRating:0,replies:[]},{commentv2:1,number:61,id:1994868,nreplies:0,sticky:0,user:'Kazane',body:'Notable loot (make sure you got everything you need before 6.0 goes live)\nThere are just a few unique models and some re-colored items.

Don\'t worry, the ghouls move very slowly and aren\'t elite, so they can be killed.\n\nAfter you defeat the ghouls, or if you have already slain Domina or Kor\'ul before clicking the brazer, the Old Gods open the door to Aku\'mai for you.\n\nNote: killing the third optional boss, Guardian of the Deep, has no effect on the final door.',date:'2014-10-26T21:01:48-05:00',rating:7,indent:0,roles:256,deleted:0,outofdate:0,userRating:0,replies:[]},{commentv2:1,number:64,id:2046531,nreplies:0,sticky:0,user:'tabbijim2009',body:'Okay, just ran this dungeon to get some transmog gear and Blizzard changed the enemies in here and placed some of the scattered bosses in new areas in the dungeon. What was once a some what boring dungeon that didn\'t make much sense as far as the quests went, has received a much needed change.\n\nThe story line in here now makes sense and is much more straight forward. When you first enter you had to get four quests, one each from the four night elves, now you get one from one night elf. The Naga are all gone along with there friends the satyrs. They have been replaced with more of the Twilight\'s Hammer. So instead of Twilight\'s Hammer being more towards the end they are now throughout the entire dungeon. \n\nYour job now is to free the people who are to be sacrificed to the once three headed hydra is now a one headed blue snake that rises out of the water in the back of the room at the end. once you reach the end in the room with the four brazers now is replaced with one. The door opens once you click the one brazer. No worries none of the mobs that came into the room before are now all gone (thank god). \n\nOnce you down Aku\'mai a chest appears and the quest giver is in here as well so no leaving the dungeon and coming back in to turn the quest in. Blizzard did add a few new things several tentacles now come out of the cave walls and the murlocs are now more deep water like fish with legs. They resemble their smaller version from the Throne of the Tides.\n\nI give this dungeon two thumbs up and my hats off to Blizzard for the change.',date:'2014-11-23T21:58:49-06:00',rating:2,indent:0,roles:0,deleted:0,outofdate:0,userRating:0,replies:[]},{commentv2:1,number:65,id:2061457,nreplies:1,sticky:0,user:'GamingTV',body:'Complete Playthrough in 1080p HD (Normal): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIO8if7THi4',date:'2014-12-06T10:58:48-06:00',rating:-3,indent:0,roles:0,deleted:0,outofdate:0,userRating:0,replies:[{"commentid":"2061457","id":"854128","body":"video link is the old dungeon pre-patch 6.0.3","userid":"1021255","username":"cUnAzeroth","roles":"0","creationdate":"2015-03-13T01:17:55-05:00","lasteditdate":"1969-12-31T18:00:00-06:00","rating":"0"}]},{commentv2:1,number:66,id:2078176,nreplies:0,sticky:0,user:'sitecow09',body:'Does anyone else find it weird that of all things, of all times (when the Alliance and Horde are occupied with the Iron Horde), this dungeon gets updated?

<ul>
<li><div><a>Ghamoo-Ra</a> – When the Twilight's Hammer cult arrived, its followers roused and imprisoned one of the last peaceful creatures living in Elune's temple. The cult delighted in tormenting the giant turtle for years, flaying its mind and body until it succumbed to madness. Naming the beast Ghamoo-Ra, the cultists attempt to control its savagery in order to protect their lair.</div></li>
<li><div><a href="/npc=74565">Subjugator Kor'ul</a> – The Twilight Hammer commanded their powerful enforcer, Subjugator Kor'ul, to cleanse the caves of anything not under their control. Gelihast was first to fall under the crushing strength of Kor'ul, who then seized control of the cave dwelling murlocs. Kor'ul left Gelihast's twisted corpse on display as proof of his dominance and now uses the murlocs to horde the possessions of those who perish in these caves.</div></li>
<li><div><a href="/npc=74476">Domina</a> – When Lady Sarevess failed to provide magical protection, Domina sacrificed the naga to empower her own dark ritual. Unlike her predecessor, Domina, Mistress of the Dark, has no fear of Aku'mai and hand feeds the beast countless innocents in order to curry favor with the Old Gods.</div></li>
<li><div><a href="/npc=74728">Twilight Lord Bathiel</a> – The Twilight Hammer do not tolerate failure, so the first command Twilight Lord Bathiel gave once he assumed control of Blackfathom Deeps was to throw Lord Kelris into the hungry maw of Aku'mai.  Now, this elemental ascended commits the depths of his unfathomable power to raising the beast of the Old Gods and covering the world in black.</div></li>
<li><div><a href="/npc=75408">Aku'mai</a> – Aku'mai, an ancient evil, carries within him a small measure of the Old Gods' power. This three-headed hydra is greatly feared for his mindless savagery and insatiable hunger for living flesh, but the Twilight's Hammer worships him as a divine sign that the Old Gods will soon return.</div></li>
<li><div><a href="/npc=75410">Guardian of the Deep</a> – Underneath the cursed Moonshrine Ruins, ancient creatures battle for territory. Old Serra'kis was driven from the ruins by The Guardian of the Deep who was seeking new spawning grounds. Now, the Guardian watches over thousands of eggs until they can hatch, and spread throughout the waterways of Azeroth.</div></li>

Great instance for the mid-20's but you should be moving onto bigger things by level 30 such as Gnomeregan or Razorfen Kraul.<br />This dungeon is comprable to the Stockades in Stormwind City (<a href="http://atlasmod.com/Maps/TheStockade.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://atlasmod.com/Maps/TheStockade.jpg</a> ), but the drops are more geared towards casters and other intellect users, though there are some items for all classes in both instances.<br />This is a great instance for Druids and Priests.</div>

The drops here are actually static -- bosses repeatedly and dependably (well, most of the time, anyway... sigh) drop the same items, so that immediately makes this instance an improvement over the Stockades.<br /><br />Another point I'd like to make (which I accidentally posted on an item's page, oops) is that it's quite useful to have a Warlock in the party for their underwater breathing buff, Unending Breath (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=5697">http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=5697</a>). You may not think so, but there are a lot of underwater encounters here and it's very helpful to not have to worry about running out of breath.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jeffzi</b></h3>
Does anyone run this instance anymore? I've started a healer and am trying to bone up on healing in the lower-level instances. I was able to find groups for The Stockade and Deadmines no problem, but during 2 full days of playing I was constantly pinging for a group to run BFD and got 0 responses.<br /><br />I've noticed that some instances you're better off going to the zone in question and pinging as opposed to trying in a city - is this one of those instances? Any advice here on finding a group (other than the obvious guild / friends / etc)?<br /><br />Lots of good Priest gear in there!!</div>

I searched for over an hour for this dungeon, now i know its location is simple;It is located on the border of Darkshore and The Zoram Strand. Near the hills in the north of ZS, behind the meeting stone. Oh and if you can do it in a group.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xtremekiller</b></h3>
I advice bringing someone who can dispel poison as the murlocs near Gelihast have a very potent poison which does 50 dmg every 5secs, and this can kill someone very quickly.</div>

In response to Devtek's post, there are actually Blue drops in the Stockade, but, the catch is they drop from a rare spawn. Bruegal Ironknuckle<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=1720">http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=1720</a></div>

<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1740">The Orb of Soran'ruk</a> as well as the paladin hammer quest should be added to this zone's quest list.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jormundgand</b></h3>
This instance was successfully duoed a couple of days after Patch 2.3 by a level 27 Fury Warrior (using a shield) and a level 27 Frost Mage. All in all it is pretty easy apart from Aku'mai which requires some kiting by the mage because the boss does a lot of damage resulting the warrior's death at about 40-50%. Being level 28 would make it quite a bit easier because the warrior has shield wall by then.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gamedisciple</b></h3>
Hey, this may sound trivial, but at level 57 my character still received 2,000 Argent Dawn rep for the two quests in this zone. I'd recommend hitting these lowbie spots first before grinding further on Argent Dawn.<br /><br />The two quests both start in Darnassus:<br /><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1198">http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1198</a><br /><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1199">http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1199</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>infinitypanda</b></h3>
The most fun low-level instance until you get into ZF or Mara in my opinion. Great atmosphere, fun to play, I suggest each toon run this at least once just for the fun factor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>henry56566</b></h3>
i agree thius instance isnt the funnest forr the horde but its fun in my opinion the best instance for the horde is WC until ULD or RFD</div>

Entrance is at about 10,14 in Ashenvale.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Valdan</b></h3>
Entrance is 14/14 However once you step on the stone prior to jumping in water it states 43/35 oddly enough.</div>

This dungeon has probably the most varied boss progression before Zul'farrak... put it alongside Stockades' blandness and Gnomeregan's annoying alarm bots and diseases, and BFD's colourful mixture of Naga, Humans and beasts shines. The loot is good, especially for leather wearers, and the difficulty curve is excellent too, the early bosses are straight tank-and-spank, but it becomes more interesting later on. There's even a smidge of real challenge. Overall I'd rate this is the most fun dungeon between Deadmines and Scarlet Monastery.<br /><br />It definitely does help to have a Warlock along for the water breathing buff, or bring a bunch of water breathing potions. There are some quest objectives under water, and various parts where you need to swim through underwater passages to progress. Druid healers are good here, as there are quite a few mobs which can be Hibernated.<br /><br />Note that there is also one &quot;jumping&quot; section where you have to jump from pillar to pillar in order to progress, which can be a little aggravating - remember to be patient and wait for the jumping-impaired ;D<br /><br />Here's a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?maps=331:156186">map location</a> for those without coords <br /><br />This place is not so easy to find, the entrance is hidden under a pool. You'll see the meeting stone near a raised square temple which has a central pool down below inside, jump into that then swim beneath and to the north, and after a couple of seconds you'll come up in a tunnel system filled with wandering elites. Follow the tunnels and eventually you'll find the instance entry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rarehunter</b></h3>
For hunters who are interested in getting Naga Heartpiercer or Naga Battle Gloves (both of which drop from Lady Saveress, second boss of BFD), you can easily solo the instance until there at level 26 or above.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FinnrSlayer</b></h3>
Bring casters to the instance, when you use beast lore on first boss he has like 30k ARMOR</div>

When you die, you will not be able to go in and get your body. (cause you can't go below water as ghost)... has anyone found another way in as ghost?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fayne</b></h3>
You can, in fact, go underwater as a ghost. You just have to hold down the left mouse button, and the right mouse button down simultaneously (like instead of pressing W or the Up arrow key to run). After that, drag the mouse down, so that you're looking at your character's feet. Bada-Bing, Bada-Boom, you're swimming as a ghost.</div>

Located north west of ashenvale, there is a horde camp a bit south of it. Let me remind you this is a HORDE CAMP, sorry alliance. <br /><br />Great place for drops to keep on coming in for. Not the best for twinking since items are 19-25<br /><br />At the start, you have to have some 1337 skills at jumping, Nah, you just cant suck. Jump over blocks of missing ground, easy for hunters with AotH.</div>

Most of the quests level 19s can pick up, so this dungeon is one of the main instances twinks need, quest rewards are amazing. Just get a 70 to handle what you pulled, run in pass everything use speed increasers if you can, when you die let the 70 kill what you pulled, do <u><b>NOT</b></u> release spirit, or you will not have the option of getting the drops. Have the 70 ( Paladin, Preist, Shaman, Druid ) ress you, or maybe a Warlock soulstone. Then get the quest objective item, And <b>BINGO</b> you got yourself a completely awsome twink. Although other instances are bigger objectives because there is not many 19- quests here.</div>

after 'Echoes of Doom 3.0.2 patch' every quest in this instance is easily soloable for rogue class (lvl 28 in my case)<br /><br />i higly recommend spending talent points in imp ambush for lvling and such...<br />weapon swap macro is a must<br /><br />with WC gears (able to stealth run through when above lvl 24) and herbalism rank2 HoT, you will be able to kill every boss<br /><br />before confronting the orc warlock boss make sure to kill the patrolling adds, if each mob seams to close to each other, sap and kill them<br /><br />couple of healing potion might be a nice backup but not really necessary<br /><br />farm 3 items (bracer, gloves, bow) for next easier stealth run instance</div>

This dungeon is a good place for twinks, all the items are around the same level and the bosses are simple fights.<br /><br />Ghamoo-ra- built like a tank. Very low damage output but high health and exceptionally good armour. Despite this his most common drop, Ghamoo-ras bind, is a caster item.Avoid area of effects if you want speed, as the turtles around him are passive even if he is attacked.<br /><br />Lady Saveress-always has a body guard, has a bow and chain lightning attack, so twinks dont go too near or you could get hurt. Easy kill, good for hunter that dual wield, gloves with good agility, strength and stamina, a bow with extra agility, and two swords with extra strength and a proc.<br /><br />Gelihast- dual weilder quick striker and the mobs around him pull very easy, good DPS warrior drops, high strength gloves and a 2h axe. always get the blessing from his altar afterwards as a little bonus.<br /><br />Kelris is basically an improved version of the walocks around him, good caster drops, clear the room beforehand.<br /><br />Serrakis is simple, tho a shammy or warlock breathing spell is useful if you dont have extreme DPS . He is under the temple in a cave with no air pockets. N.B. always take a hunter with you:a pet makes a good emergency tank and tracking for finding bosses/pats/stealthing mobs/underwater creatures is infinitely useful here.<br /><br />Akumai hits like a !@#$% and has high health, a pet is useful here as both healrs and the hunter can help them out, plus it means she wont hit the main tank for the majority of he fihgt. Varied drops, another altar at the back, and a dwarf who can telly you to Darnassus, useful after doing Blackfathom Villainy.</div>

Back in the days of classic WoW, touching the Altar of the Deep in Aku'mai's Lair triggered a trap, teleporting the character high in the air outside Blackfathom Deep (if I remember correctly) and making them fall all the way to the ground.<br />Now it works just like the other Altar in the chamber with the murloc boss (aka gives a buff).</div>

HOW TO GET IN THE BFD:<br /><br />1. Check the screenshot showing the ruin that's the entrance to the dungeon<br />2. When you get to the building jump into the water and swim to the cave ( you'll recognise it by the Naga-s ( its the only cave so you can't miss it))<br />3. Make your way trough the cave<br />4. The portal to the dungeon is at the end of the cave and it's easy to spot. <br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />As for the dungeon it's not very hard with nice drops. Mobs are easy to kill and even 2-3 ppl can do it with no problem with 1 being a healer.</div>

Do 1 flame at a time unless you know for sure your tank/healer can handle a bunch of small, non-elites and several elite mobs in 3.0? grab a 80 have them run you through less QQ more PEW PEW noob! - Vezta!<br /><br />Now its grab an 85 and let them do the killing while the low levels do the chilling!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jessican666</b></h3>
Situated along the Zoram Strand of Ashenvale, Blackfathom Deeps was once a glorious temple dedicated to the night elves' moon goddess, Elune. However, the Great Sundering shattered the temple - sinking it beneath the waves of the Veiled Sea. There, the temple remained untouched until naga and satyr, drawn by its ancient power, emerged to plumb its secrets.<br /><br />Legends hold that Aku'mai, a favored pet of the primordial Old Gods, has taken up residence within the temple's ruins. The cult known as the Twilight's Hammer has also come to bask in Aku'mai's evil presence - and members of the shamanic order known as the Earthen Ring rush to oppose them, knowing that where the Old Gods are invoked, dangers to the whole of Azeroth cannot be far behind.<br /><br />This underwater cove can be tricky to navigate for the first time, but it's a great place to hone your skills and find your role when in a group.<br />Level appropriate groups should watch out for two things. The first is that there are many magic casting Naga which, when amassed in numbers, can do a good deal of damage. Always keep a warrior with shield bash on any casting mobs, or any other class that can stun/interrupt like Shamans and Paladins. Also, this is a great dungeon to try out crowd control. Many of the enemies pulled to you will come with friends. In addition, there are invisible Satyr that you cannot see until they have come close enough to aggro you.<br /><br />Caution should be used when combating the murlocs. Once at low health, they run quite fast, often running back towards the other murlocs and the murloc boss Gelihast. Keep a form of snare on these guys. The latter part of the instance includes the Twilight Cultists. These foes come in groups of two or three, but often can include more if you aren't aware of wanderers. The ideal way to avoid an unwanted add is to pull with range, targeting the casters first (which you can get to follow you by cutting the Line of Sight, i.e. turning around a corner), and sheeping, sapping, or off tanking the adds. Also, having the highest level person in your group do the pulling helps, due to their smaller aggro radius.<br /><br />The 'summoning chamber' with Twilight Lord Kelris includes many other cultists in the room. It is recommended to use the walled off entrance to your advantage, pulling the mobs one by one from the large room until Kelris is alone. After the room is cleared, he is ready to be engaged safely. Once he is defeated, all four candles pieces on the middle altar will need to be lit in order to advance past the large door to the final boss. Right-click these one at a time because a small group of mobs is summoned from the adjacent doors every time you do. Defeat these one at a time to avoid death.<br /><br />The final boss is relatively easy if you have a dedicated tank and healer. See walk-through for Aku'mai. A stylishly hatted dwarf will await you at the end, giving Alliance players an option to port to Darnassus.<br /><br /><b><u>Ghamoo-Ra:</u></b><br />When the Twilight's Hammer cult arrived, its followers roused and imprisoned one of the last peaceful creatures living in Elune's temple. The cult delighted in tormenting the giant turtle for years, flaying its mind and body until it succumbed to madness. Naming the beast Ghamoo-Ra, the cultists trained it to attack outsiders and defend the Old Gods' shrine.<br /><br />Note: Tameable by Hunters.<br /><br />Ghamoo-Ra lives on the small island in the second cavern of the instance. He roams around the center of the landmass and is surrounded by several other turtles. The additional turtles are neutral, and Ghamoo-Ra can be engaged without disturbing these other beasts.<br />The fight with Ghamoo-Ra is fairly straightforward, although due to Ghamoo-Ra's high armor value the encounter can last a fair amount of time if your group is melee heavy or generally low on DPS. He only casts Trample, which is an AoE physical damage spell. It can be blocked.<br /><br /><b><u>Lady Sarevess:</u></b><br />The Twilight's Hammer granted Lady Sarevess her own private cove within Blackfathom Deeps, continuously sending her fresh sacrifices. The cultists hope that her rituals and research will result in magical protection that will allow them to worship the terrifying hydra at the deeps' core without fear of becoming his next meal.<br /><br />She can kill you if you are not too careful, for she will spam Forked Lightning quite a few times so have the tank face her away from the rest of the group. Other than that, there is nothing special about her. She moves around the cave, so pull her when there are no mobs near.<br /><br /><b><u>Gelihast:</u></b><br />The Old Gods called, and Gelihast answered, forcing his way into Blackfathom Deeps and slaughtering nearly a dozen surprised Twilight's Hammer cultists with his twin swords. Impressed by his ferocity and brutality, the cult allowed him to stay, and he built his own shrine to offer sacrifices and receive blessings from the ominous presence in the temple ruins.<br /><br />He goes down quite quickly but he can interrupt and kill casters very quickly, dealing high damage as he is wielding 2 swords and has an incredible attack speed. Killing him allows access to an altar, when used it gives the beneficial debuff Blessing of Blackfathom. Warriors can kill him in a few seconds with and a 2-handed weapon. Gelihast is in a large room filled with Blindlight Murlocs, and it is not uncommon for a fleeing Murloc to pull him into the fight causing a wipe.<br /><br /><b><u>Lorgus Jett:</u></b><br />Lorgus Jett is a level 25 rare human member of the Twilight's Hammer in the Moonshrine Ruins of Blackfathom Deeps. He has a variable spawn point, the earliest of which is in a dead end tunnel just after Gelihast and the last of which is near the first pull of Twilight cultists.<br /><br /><b><u>Old Serra'kis:</u></b><br />Many of the creatures swimming beneath the Moonshrine Ruins were killed for food after the Twilight's Hammer cult took up residence, but the largest thresher in the water proved to be uncatchable, and those who persisted in hunting it inevitably died in the attempt.<br /><br />Finding Serra'kis is harder than the actual fight. To reach him, you must dive into the water around Moonshrine Sanctum and swim under the left side of the ruins. Thankfully the fight isn't tough and as long as you're careful not to run out of breath you shouldn't have any problems. Having a Warlock or Shaman to cast Water Breathing is helpful here. If you are unable to do this, it will be difficult to kill him quickly enough because the cave he is located in does not have an opening to the surface for air. Kiting him out of the cave may be a better option than fighting him inside it in this case.<br />Also note that Serra'kis regularly heals himself for a small portion of his health using a melee ability. With decent dps, this will not be a problem. Those groups with unusually low dps may not be able to overcome his healing, as can be the case when a weak group of 3 or 4 attempt Serra'kis.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jessican666</b></h3>
<b><u>Continued</u></b><br /><br /><b><u>Twilight Lord Kelris</u></b><br />When the cultists found a strange three-headed creature in the belly of Blackfathom Deeps, Twilight Lord Kelris was convinced the hydra was a herald of the Old Gods' return to Azeroth... and his ticket to immortality. Kelris personally supervises the growth of the monster, even feeding him his own subjects to satisfy his wild hunger.<br /><br />Kelris is in a trance as you enter the room, so you have to attack him before he will respond. He is not accompanied by any guards, so it is possible to pull him without aggroing any adds. It is also unfortunately very easy to pull some more mobs in the room with him, so be careful. This should be an easy fight for a competent group. Watch for the mind control he casts periodically. He will also put players to sleep, so be prepared to pick up the slack from an incapacitated player. He runs around a lot when he is casting, so it is advisable to either clear the room before killing him, or pulling him outside onto the steps.<br /><br /><b><u>The Altar</u></b><br />There are 4 candles on the altar he is praying to. After Kelris is dead, light these ONE at a time. Each one will spawn a large group of elites (Aku'mai Servant) after a 5-10 second delay. Without a higher level in your group, if you light more than one at a time you will wipe.<br />After all the candles have been lit, the door to Aku'mai is opened.<br /><br /><b><u>Aku'mai</u></b><br />Aku'mai, an ancient evil, carries within him a small measure of the Old Gods' power. This three-headed hydra is greatly feared for his mindless savagery and insatiable hunger for living flesh, but the Twilight's Hammer worships him as a divine sign that the Old Gods will soon return.<br /><br />The ancient hydra Aku'mai, princess of the deep, has taken up residence within the Blackfathom Deeps, which once was a glorious temple dedicated to the night elves' moon-goddess Elune. A favored pet of the primordial Old Gods, Aku'mai has been a scourge to the Zoram Strand for ages. Drawn to Aku'mai's presence in the Deeps, the cult known as the Twilight's Hammer has gathered to bask in the Old Gods' evil presence by sacrificing innocents to the monstrous beast in order to gain favor with her twisted masters.<br /><br />Aku'mai provides a pretty straightforward fight, but that doesn't make it easy. The big hydra has a vast load of health and hits like a truck hitting you with a slightly smaller truck. She also has a poison attack that's worth keeping an eye on. Keep your tank healed and make sure he or she can keep aggro well while the rest of the group unloads everything they've got onto Aku'mai. the person who is resurrecting, cast all buffs, and give her hell.<br />She is able to reduce any tank into a bite of snakefood with a few attacks, if he or she is not protected properly. A warrior might have a better time with her, but a paladin can serve as a tank as well.<br />Aku'mai is not immune to or snares.<br /><br />Good Luck.<br />Happy Hunting.</div>

The door beyond Twilight Lord Bathiel has a different mechanic to open than it did when Kelris occupied the room. Previously, players had to click on four brazers, each of which spawned a wave of mobs that had to be defeated. (Impatient players often spawned all four waves at once, much to the peril of the group.)<br /><br />In the Warlords of Draenor update, there are brazers present, but you only need to click one. What happens will depend on which bosses you have killed. You'll notice that the shrine behind Bathiel has a floating purple crystal. If you slay the optional bosses Domina or Subjugator Kor'ul, their spirits will be visible floating next the the crystal. Clicking the brazer without killing either Domina or Kor'ul will cause the Old Gods to taunt you and spawn a massive wave of ghouls to eat you. Don't worry, the ghouls move very slowly and aren't elite, so they can be killed.<br /><br />After you defeat the ghouls, or if you have already slain Domina or Kor'ul before clicking the brazer, the Old Gods open the door to Aku'mai for you.<br /><br />Note: killing the third optional boss, Guardian of the Deep, has no effect on the final door.</div>

Okay, just ran this dungeon to get some transmog gear and Blizzard changed the enemies in here and placed some of the scattered bosses in new areas in the dungeon. What was once a some what boring dungeon that didn't make much sense as far as the quests went, has received a much needed change.<br /><br />The story line in here now makes sense and is much more straight forward. When you first enter you had to get four quests, one each from the four night elves, now you get one from one night elf. The Naga are all gone along with there friends the satyrs. They have been replaced with more of the Twilight's Hammer. So instead of Twilight's Hammer being more towards the end they are now throughout the entire dungeon. <br /><br />Your job now is to free the people who are to be sacrificed to the once three headed hydra is now a one headed blue snake that rises out of the water in the back of the room at the end. once you reach the end in the room with the four brazers now is replaced with one. The door opens once you click the one brazer. No worries none of the mobs that came into the room before are now all gone (thank god). <br /><br />Once you down Aku'mai a chest appears and the quest giver is in here as well so no leaving the dungeon and coming back in to turn the quest in. Blizzard did add a few new things several tentacles now come out of the cave walls and the murlocs are now more deep water like fish with legs. They resemble their smaller version from the Throne of the Tides.<br /><br />I give this dungeon two thumbs up and my hats off to Blizzard for the change.</div>

Does anyone else find it weird that of all things, of all times (when the Alliance and Horde are occupied with the Iron Horde), this dungeon gets updated? Considering we'v gone 2 expansions now without much direct Old God influence (Garrosh was the one using Y'Sharrj's power and we don't see much OG action in Draenor), maybe this is a sign that the remaining Old Gods, including N'zoth, are soon going to play their hand.</div>
